# Ignore Docker specific files if they are generated locally outside of images
# .dockerignore is the preferred way to exclude files from the Docker image build context

# --- Environment Variables ---
# CRITICAL: Never commit your .env file!
.env
.env.*.local
.env.local
.env.development.local
.env.test.local

# --- Application Build Output ---
# (Adjust based on your specific application framework/language)
# For example:
# build/
# dist/
# target/
# public/build/ # Example for Symfony Encore
# node_modules/ # If you build frontend assets locally before Docker
# vendor/ # For PHP Composer dependencies, if not managed solely within Docker
